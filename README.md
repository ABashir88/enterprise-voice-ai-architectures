# Enterprise Voice AI Architectures

## Overview

This repository documents **real-world reference architectures, cost and latency models, and sales-engineering playbooks** for enterprise-grade **Voice AI, CPaaS, UCaaS, and CCaaS** systems.

It is designed to reflect how **production Voice AI platforms are actually evaluated, sold, deployed, and scaled** in regulated, high-volume environments — not how they are demoed.

The focus is on **low-latency voice**, **LLM-powered conversational workflows**, **telephony and media infrastructure**, and the **technical tradeoffs enterprise buyers care about**.

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is intentionally written for:

- Enterprise Account Executives selling Voice AI, CPaaS, or CCaaS platforms  
- Sales Engineers and Solutions Architects supporting voice and AI workloads  
- Product and GTM leaders working on real-time communications or conversational AI  
- Technical buyers evaluating latency, reliability, cost, and scale tradeoffs  

It assumes familiarity with enterprise sales cycles and avoids “hello world” explanations.

## What This Repository Covers

- **Voice AI reference architectures** (real-time, batch, hybrid)
- **CPaaS vs CCaaS design tradeoffs** for AI-driven voice workflows
- **Latency budgets and media path considerations**
- **STT / TTS / LLM cost modeling at scale**
- **Failure modes, bottlenecks, and operational risks**
- **Sales-engineering frameworks** for discovery, qualification, and technical validation
- **Architecture-level thinking** aligned to enterprise buyer concerns

This is not a coding repository.  
It is an **architecture and systems thinking repository**.
